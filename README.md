# Hotel-Demand-Analysis-and-Prediction---Predictive-Analytics
The tourism industry is very dynamic and is easily affected by many factors such as natural disasters, economic situations of varying countries, pandemics, etc. Therefore, any insight on what to expect in the coming days can be very beneficial for hotel owners and managers. Forecasting the average daily rate will give hotel owners some idea of what their profits or losses will look like. The same goes for having a prediction for how many bookings they can expect to retain and therefore they can then estimate what their profits may look like.
